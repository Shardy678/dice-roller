# D&D Dice Rolling Script

This is a simple Python script that simulates rolling various types of dice used in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). The script provides a command-line interface for users to input dice notations and see the results of their rolls.

## Features

- Roll different types of dice (e.g., d4, d6, d20) with a specified number of sides.
- Get individual roll results and the total sum of the rolls.
- Continuous rolling: The script allows you to keep rolling dice.
- User-friendly: The script prompts you for dice notation and provides clear results.

## Usage

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
   ```shell
   python main.py
   
2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
- Enter the dice notation (e.g., 2d6) to roll the specified number of dice with the specified number of sides.

3. View the results:
The script will display the individual roll results and the total sum of the rolls.

## Example

```python
$ python main.py
Enter the dice notation (e.g., 2d6): 3d8
Rolls: [5, 3, 8]
Total: 16
Enter the dice notation (e.g., 2d6): 1d20
Rolls: [18]
Total: 18
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
